# Sample Code for Build watchOS Apps

Build watchOS Apps is a book written by [Mark Goody](http://twitter.com/marramgrass) and [Maurice Kelly](http://twitter.com/mauricerkelly) -- that's us -- and published by Peachpit Press. If you don't already own the book, why not head over to the companion site ([http://watchosapps.build/](http://watchosapps.build/)) for more information about it, and links to purchase. If you do own the book, thanks for purchasing!

## Getting the Sample Code

The book contains numerous example projects, which we have published to GitHub as a collection of repositories -- one for each chapter that requires it. Below, you'll find a series of links to the individual repos, but the easiest way to get them all in one fell swoop is to pull down this repo, which contains the rest as submodules:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bwa-book/sample-code
```
